# 2015HackUCI

## Inspiration
There are too few faculty members in CS department that it is impossible to take classes nowadays.

## What it does
This app communicates with UCI web server **every minute** to check the availability of the class and lets you know when it becomes available! This app is **free** to use and you can use it **with as many classes as you want**! 
Alternative solutions cost money because of their project's weight. We focused on building a lightweight project which can more efficiently and effectively meet the goals of the users.

## How We built it
We started from sample programs which allowed us to start building and getting feedback right away.

## Challenges I ran into
We had to struggle so much trying to remind ourselves of the programming languages we barely used. Also, we did not have enough time to be able to expand our program to something much greater.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This is one of the teammate's first ever web app ever deployed!

## What I learned
We refreshed our memory on programming languages and database. We got to learn how to implement database and web application in python, flask environment. We learned to parse website using lxml.

## What's next for My UCI Class is Full
We want to provide help for students who don't end up taking the classes they want to take, since the number of people who actually take the occasional empty spots is very small.
We aim to write additional program to plan out their future course work that helps them graduate by the time they want, by providing the best possible set of classes they can take during the current quarter, with remainder of classes.
